# Dagger2-CLEAN-MVP Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/voghDev/dagger2-clean-mvp-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/voghDev/dagger2-clean-mvp-example)

Sample project with the first steps of my approach to Android CLEAN architecture, based on elegant solutions from respected developers.
Features a List of users, obtained from randomuser API.
Some of the aspects covered on this project are:

* Dependency Injection using [Dagger2][6].
* Elegant ~~ListView~~ **RecyclerView** implementation using [Renderers][15].
* View binding using Jake Wharton's [ButterKnife 6.x][11] (current is 8.x).
* Image loading using [picasso][12], round transformations using **PorterDuff**.
* Creating an image cache with [picasso][12].
* Model-View-Presenter + Interactor + DataSource layers, with different **DataSource**s:
  * a REST Api using [retrofit][13]
  * a local **JSON file**
  * a class generating **mock** instances
* Code-style rules using [checkstyle][16]. [This blogpost][17] indicates how checkstyle has been imported
* Android Unit testing using JUnit 4 and [Mockito][18].
* UI Testing using [Espresso][19]
* Low-boilerplate **MVP** implementation using generics (splitted into Presenter / APresenter / APresenterImpl).
* [Travis CI][22] integration including instrumentation tests ran on an AVD. see [.travis.yml script][23]
